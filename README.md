# Simple Nodejs Application for Various Learning Tasks

---

## About 🤔

I created this project because I was not able to find a git repo on Github which was simple and easy to use in various tasks (such as Automation, Pipelines, Containerization, Monitoring etc). Hope you would enjoy it. Star 🌟 the repo if you like it!

## Building and running Application 🚀

You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

This will create a folder name `node_modules` in the project directory
This doesn't mean that it will install the app but it will just download and place the dependencies in the `node_modules` directory. Which means if you delete the `node_modules` directory anything which `npm install` command did will be reverted back to its original form.

then you can run the application using:

```bash
node app.js
```

The application will run on Port `8080` by default. You can override this behavior by setting the value of `PORT` variable in your Environment.

For Example to make the Port `8000`. Run the following:

```bash
export PORT=8000
```

Good Luck! 👍
